\end{figure}


\textbf{Editing a Photo}

Images can be edited in the graph using the various editing nodes. These nodes can be connected to the image input node to apply the desired effect.
The nodes will perform manipulations on the image and output the result. This result can then be connected to other nodes to create a chain of effects.
It should be noted that this functionality does not only apply to images, but to any input given.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Plugins}
\subsection*{Plugins}

One of the core features of Blix is its plugin system. This system allows users to create their own plugins and add them to the application. This enables users to create their own custom nodes and 
add them to the graph. This section will serve as a guide to creating your own plugins.

\textbf{Using plugins}

Blix ensures that every node in the graph is a plugin. This means that all node functionality is extremely extensible and add them to the graph. Key features include : 

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbullet] Plugin files are stored in the blix-plugins folder.
  \item[\textbullet] Users can create their own plugins and share them with other users.
  \item[\textbullet] Every property of the node is defined in the plugin file.
  \item[\textbullet] The ai system uses all plugins, including your own!
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Creating plugins}

Blix allows users to create and customize their own plugins with an elegant and intuitive interface. Users can define nodes, commands and tiles.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbullet] Nodes are constructed using the dedicated nodeBuilders provided in our docs.
  \item[\textbullet] Commands are more loosely created by users, however well defined commands are provided in our system.
  \item[\textbullet] Tiles are created using the dedicated tileBuilders provided in our docs.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  {\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../pics/tutorial-Plugins.png}}
  \caption{Example of a node defined in a plugin}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Using the Artificial Intelligence}

Blix allows users to communicate with an LLM that is fine-tuned to our system. 
The AI can be used to perform a wide array of tasks and provide the user with a more intuitive and easy to use experience.
you will receive a response from the AI in the information panel in the bottom right corner of the screen.

\textbf{Use Cases}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbullet] Create a graph to perform  specific tasks based on the user's prompt.
  \item[\textbullet] Modify an existing graph by adding or removing nodes or editing their connections and properties.
  \item[\textbullet] Provide the user with valuable information about the graph.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How to use}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbullet] A prompt can be sent to the AI by using the command palette. Pressing TAB after typing a prompt in the command palette will send the prompt to the AI.
  \item[\textbullet] The AI will then proceed to process the command and perform the neccesary actions based on the user prompt
  \item[\textbullet] The AI will then return a response to the user, which will be displayed through the information panel in the bottom right corner of the screen.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

  {\includegraphics[width=0.7 \textwidth]{../pics/tutorial-AI.png}}
  \caption{Response from the AI}
\end{figure}


\textbf{General prompt guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbullet] Try to be as specific as possible when sending a prompt to the AI.
  \item[\textbullet] Shorter/smaller tasks are more likely to be performed correctly.
  \item[\textbullet] Look at the AI's response in the information panel.
\end{itemize}
