\section*{Introduction}

Blix is a native cross-platform desktop application designed to provide users
with a powerful and intuitive photo editing experience.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Purpose and Vision}
\subsection*{Purpose and Vision}

In photography, editing is an essential part of the process. However, it can be
time-consuming and daunting, especially for those unfamiliar with the techniques
and software. 

Blix is a native, cross-platform desktop application designed to give users a
powerful, intuitive photo editing experience. It enables users to edit photos 
using a node-based system, which describes the image processing pipeline. This
offers creative control to professionals, while still being intuitive for 
novice users.

The system provides functionality for basic photo editing operations, like white
balance and saturation. It also has advanced operations, such as image
segmentation, which allows users to edit selected objects individually and
provides infilling. 

Users can customize the themes and layout of the application. The viewport is
splittable and users can arrange components throughout the window layout. It has
a command palette which enables users to efficiently navigate and control the
system. This allows users to change themes, add nodes to the graph, manage
projects and more. It also has a custom AI prompt box where users can describe
their vision of the image, which will then be processed to generate a result.

The system also allows users to sync their photo editing projects and user
preferences to the cloud, including window layout, keymap settings and themes.

\subsection*{Characteristics}

\subsubsection*{Novice Users}

Novice users are typically individuals who have little to no experience with
photo editing software. They may be unfamiliar with the terminology and tools
used in the application, and may require guidance and assistance with basic
tasks such as importing and exporting photos, adjusting brightness and contrast,
cropping and resizing images, and applying filters and effects. Novice users may
also be less comfortable with technology in general, and may require a more
intuitive and user-friendly interface to help them navigate the application.


\subsubsection*{Intermediate Users}

An intermediate user is someone who has a good understanding of the basic
features and tools of the application, but may not be familiar with more
advanced techniques. They are likely to have experience with editing photos and
may have used similar applications before. They are comfortable navigating the
interface and using tools such as crop, resize, and color adjustments. They may
also be interested in learning more advanced techniques such as layering,
masking, and retouching to enhance their photos. 

\subsubsection*{Professional Users}

A professional user of a photo editing application is typically someone who has
a deep understanding of photography and image editing techniques. They are
likely to have experience using a variety of photo editing software and are
proficient in using advanced features such as layers, masks, and color
correction tools. They may work in fields such as graphic design, advertising,
or photography and require a high level of precision and control over their
edits. Professional users may also value features such as batch processing and
the ability to work with large files or RAW image formats. They may also
prioritize software that integrates well with other tools in their workflow,
such as design software or cloud storage services.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stories}
\subsection*{Stories}

\subsubsection*{Novice users}

I want the application to have a simple and intuitive interface, so that I can
easily navigate and understand how to use it.

I want the application to provide basic editing tools, such as crop and rotate,
so that I can quickly make simple adjustments to my photos.

I want the application to offer a variety of pre-set filters and effects, so
that I can easily enhance the look of my photos without needing to learn
advanced editing techniques.

\subsubsection*{Intermediate users}

I want the application to offer more advanced editing tools, such as levels and
curves, so that I can fine-tune the exposure and color of my photos.

I want the application to provide a range of creative options, such as overlays
and textures, so that I can experiment with different styles and effects.

I want the application to provide easy sharing options, so that I can quickly
post my edited photos to my favorite platforms.

I want to be able to upload and edit multiple photos at once.

I want to be able to adjust advanced settings such as white balance, hue,
exposure, cropping, and rotating manually.

I want to be able to select objects in the image using image segmentation and
edit them separately.

I want to be able to search for projects by the content of the images inside of
them.

I want to be able to customize the panel layout to my preference.


\subsubsection*{Professional users}

I want the application to offer advanced retouching tools, such as frequency
separation and dodge and burn, so that I can make precise adjustments to my
photos.

I want the application to support high-resolution files and offer advanced color
management options, so that I can create professional-quality designs.

I want the application to provide batch processing and automation options, so
that I can quickly edit and optimize large numbers of photos for use in
campaigns and advertisements.
