\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
	\item[\textbullet] {\bf Install Prerequisites}: 

	You will need to install \textbf{libvips} for the image processing and compilation of the app.
	To install libvips on Windows, you can follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item[\textbullet]{Download libvips:}
	Go to the libvips releases page on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases}
        Scroll down to the "Assets" section of the latest release.
        Download the Windows installer package with a filename like vips-dev-w64-web-xxx.exe, where xxx represents the version number.
    \item[\textbullet]{Add libvips to the System Path:}
        After installation, you need to add the libvips binary directory to your system's PATH environment variable to make it accessible from the command line.
        Right-click on "This PC" (or "My Computer") and select "Properties."
        Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left sidebar.
        In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
        Under the "System variables" section, find and select the "Path" variable, then click on "Edit."
        Click "New" and add the path to the libvips binary directory (usually something like \texttt{C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash vips\textbackslash bin}).

    \item[\textbullet]{Test the Installation (Optional):}
        Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
        Type vips --version and press Enter. This should display the libvips version information if the installation was successful.
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
		 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
	\end{lstlisting}


	\item[\textbullet] {\bf Download the app from GitHub releases for Windows}: 

	Download the \code{Blix Setup 1.0.0.exe} file which is the installer for windows.

	Go to the folder where the app was downloaded and then run the installer
	by double clicking the app.

	The installer will automatically install blix on your device. 
	You can now simply click on the blix icon on your desktop to launch the app.
